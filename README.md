# Better Twitch Following List

This is the source code for my Android app, BTFL, which allows users to keep track of their Twitch.tv following list more easily than the official Twitch app does. It features customizable pins, vodcast options, and uptime display.

Update: Unfortunately, changes to the Twitch API in January 2019 irreparably broke some of the core functionality of this app. As a result, I have decided to remove it from the Play Store.

Please note that Better Twitch Following List and its developer are not affiliated with Twitch Interactive, Inc. in any way.
